This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Code Quality

This project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) with [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to ensure code quality before commits.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Before each commit, the following actions are automatically performed on staged files:

- **Prettier formatting** for all supported file types (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.json`, `.css`, `.md`, `.mdx`)
- **ESLint fixes** for JavaScript/TypeScript files

### Manual Commands

You can also run these commands manually:

```bash
# Format all files with Prettier
npm run format

# Lint and fix all files
npm run lint:fix

# Run lint-staged manually (for staged files only)
npx lint-staged
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
